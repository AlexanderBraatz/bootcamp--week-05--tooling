# Level 8: Add your SSH keys to GitHub

Copy your key and add into your GitHub account in [your account settings](https://github.com/settings/ssh).

Finally, test your key with:

```bash
ssh git@github.com
```

You should get something like this with `[username]` replaced with your username:

```
Hi [username]! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

## Do you get that?

### [Yes](09-git-config.md)

### [No](99-game-over.md)
