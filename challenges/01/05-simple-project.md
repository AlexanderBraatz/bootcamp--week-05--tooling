# Build a simple site

To practice using Git while working on a project you should:

- start a new project (new folder, new Git repo)
- create 3 HTML pages each with normal HTML boilerplate: `<html>`, `<head>` and `<body>`.
- add 4 elements to each page `<div>`, `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<img>`
- create a `css` folder with stylesheet
- create a `img` folder with image(s)
- populate with some dummy content
- update some of your pages
- at appropriate points use `git add` and `git commit` to create a snapshot of your progress so far.

	This may be after creating each page, or when completing each element, this is up to you.
- At the end you should aim to have done **at least** 10 commits (use `git log` to see your commits so far)
- Aim for clear, informative commit messages.
- You will be asked to share your commit messages on Slack.

*Note: Don't worry about making your project perfect, the purpose is to practice using Git.*
