## Version manage some new files

1) add some files into your new project

	Create a basic web project of this sort of structure:

	index.html
	↳css
		style.css
	↳js
		scripts.js

1) start version managing your files

	Use `git add {filename}` to start tracking the files in your project.

	Use `git commit -m "Some comment"` to create your first commit, with the files you had previously added to tracking.
