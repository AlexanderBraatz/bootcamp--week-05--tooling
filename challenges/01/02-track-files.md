# Version manage some new files

1) **Add some files into your new project**

	Create a basic web project of this sort of structure:

	```text
	index.html
	/css
	   style.css
	/js
	   scripts.js
	```

1) **Start version managing your files**

	Use `git status` to see what Git thinks is going on.

	Use `git add {filename}` to start tracking the files in your project.

	Use `git status` again to see what is the status now.

	Use `git commit -m "Some comment"` to create your first commit, with the files you had previously added to tracking.
