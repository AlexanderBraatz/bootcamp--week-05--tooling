# Collaborating with a remote repository

Let's improve our workflow with Pull Requests.

1) Work with feature branches locally
1) Push your branch up to GitHub
1) Then create a pull request on GitHub and assign to another team member

*Note: the project repository is available on GitHub here: [https://github.com/develop-me/git-simple](https://github.com/develop-me/git-simple)*
