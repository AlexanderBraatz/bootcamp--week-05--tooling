# Setting up to work with a remote repository

1) use `git clone` to create a new project directory on your machine, start version managing it with Git and add the remote `git@github.com:develop-me/git-simple.git` all in one go (see Notes: *5.2 Fewer commands with git clone*)

1) make some changes to the site, stage changes and commit them

1) preview changes in browser

**DO NOT do `git push` yet**
