# Setting up to work with a remote repository on GitHub

1) Set up a new project on [GitHub](https://github.com)
1) Add the remote repository to your current Git project from earlier with `git remote add origin {"Clone with SSH" URL from GitHub}`
1) Fetch information about the project at GitHub with `git fetch`
1) Push your work on master to date up to GitHub with `git push origin master` (this makes the master branch on the remote)
1) Verify your work has appeared on GitHub by viewing in the browser
1) Make further changes to your project
1) Commit changes
1) Push changes (you can use just `git push`)
1) Rinse and repeat
