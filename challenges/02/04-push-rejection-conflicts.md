# Collaborating with a remote repository

Continue working on the project, but now start to use `git push` and `git pull`.

Make 5 changes, with 5 commits, while pushing each up to GitHub.

1) do work
1) `git commit`
1) `git push`
1) if you get a push rejection then `git pull` first then `git push`
1) if you get a conflict then resolve that, commit and push again

*Note: the project repository is available on GitHub here: [https://github.com/develop-me/git-simple](https://github.com/develop-me/git-simple)*
