\section{What is Git?}

A tool, a piece of software that allows us to:

\begin{itemize}
    \item keep track of how files change over time (our code)
    \item can be used to version manage anything (text files, video, images)
    \item mainly used on command line, but GUI's are available
\end{itemize}

\begin{infobox}{Life is hard!}
    Developing websites/apps/software that works is an hard enough challenge as it is, why add another tool to that?
    \\
    In the long run it's worth it, trust us.

\section{Why version manage?}

Version management affords us:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Control
    \item Visibility
    \item Predictability
    \item Collaboration
\end{itemize}

\section{Why Git?}

There are many version management tools out there, why do we use Git?
\\

Each has its own quirks, and merits in its design.

Ultimately we use Git because others use it:

\begin{itemize}
    \item most widely used source code management tool
	\item 33.3\% of professional software developers reporting use Git or GitHub as their primary source control system
	\item excellent tooling support, supporting existing workflows and editors like VSCode, Sublime
\end{itemize}
