## Demo: setting up, linking remote

- [ ] setup GitHub
- [ ] linking remote - `git remote add origin {"Clone with SSH" URL from GitHub}`

- [ ] `git fetch`
- [ ] pushing there - `git push -u origin master`
- [ ] show code and history
- [ ] further changes only need `git push`

- [ ] branching with remote, pushing to remote
- [ ] creating pull request
